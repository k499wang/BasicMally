# Introduction

This is a basic "malware" test that simply runs a messagebox. The project has two branches:

1. **Basic Encryption Functionality**: Demonstrates basic encryption techniques.
2. **Basic Function Unhooking Functionality**: Demonstrates how to bypass hooks in a system.

This project was created as an extension of my other project: [CustomAV](https://github.com/k499wang/CustomAV).
